#### What is Programming?
Introduction to Computer Programming | What is it? Programming Language Types
- Computers need instructions given to them to do things
- These instructions are called "programs" and are written by "programmers"
- There are programs to manage computer hardware - these are system programs
- Other programs provide user functionality - such as music or video player, word, excel or notepad programs
- Computers only understand binary language - 0 & 1
- Binary uses electrical signals to communicate - 0 there is no current or communication, 1 there is a current and communication
- Machine Level Language is called a low level language - written in Binary
- Very hard to write machine level language
- Assembly Level language is a low level language
- It was created to help write code easier - written using numbers or symbols
- Assembly language used an "Assembler" to translate into Binary
- High level languages were created to make coding easier and closer to human language
- Compilation and Interpretation are used to translate high level languages into computer binary language
- Low level languages allow programmers to directly access the computer memory and work with data
- High level languages cannot directly access the computer memory and work with data
- There are Middle level languages can access the memory and data directly with all the features of High level languages
- High Level Languages - Python, Java
- Middle Level Languages - C, C++
- Machine Language is the fastest, then Assembly then High Level Languages
- Compilation uses a compiler to convert a program written in high level language and translate it into machine language
- Interpretation uses an interpreter to read each line of a program, translate and then execute that line
- Compilation compiles and translates a whole program in one go and runs the whole program
- Interpretation interprets and runs each line one at a time of a program
- Complied languages include C & C++
- Interpreted languages include Python
