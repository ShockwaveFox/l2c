What is Networking?
Computer Networks: Crash Course Computer Science #28
    - Latency - the time taken for data/packet/message to transfer
    - Local Area Network (LAN) - a group of connected devices
    - Ethernet cables - used to connect devices and send data over
    - Media Access Control (MAC) Address - unique serial assigned to each device
    - MAC addresses are used to ensure the right machine receives its message
    - Data sent over a network has the MAC address in the "header" of the message
    - Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CMSA)
    - Bandwidth - the rate that data can be sent
    - Exponential Backoff - the amount of time a device will wait after a network collision before retrying its send
    - Switch - used to separate and link machines across a network
    - Keeps a list of all devices MAC addresses to send to only the correct machine/network
    - Routers send data between and across networks
    - Hop count - the amount of hops (steps) a message takes across a network
    - Packets - large messages are broken up into smaller packets to be sent
    - Every device on a network has its own individual IP address
