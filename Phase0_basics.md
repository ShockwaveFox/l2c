What is Linux?
What is Linux? - Linux Explained
	• Linux is a Kernal that interacts with hardware, software and applications
	• The Kernal is the core of Linux
	• A Distro is a version of Linux - there are multiple available versions
	• Distros have software available for all uses the same as Windows
	• Wine is available to install Windows programs
	• Proton allows windows games to be played on Linux
	• Software is installed using packages and package managers
	• A package is a collection of files and applications
	• Package managers are like app stores to install and update packages
	• Drivers are managed by the Kernal and its modules
	• All hardware is supported out of the box
	• Linux uses less resources and memory vs Windows - good for old hardware
	• Linux is built to be secure from the ground up
	• A regular account cannot do much in the system
	• A Root password is needed to install/uninstall software or access system files
	• A Root password is set when first setting up Linux
	• Linux is compartmentalised so processes only have limited permissions
	• Using the package manager ensures you are downloading safe software

What is Networking?
Computer Networks: Crash Course Computer Science #28
	• Latency - the time taken for data/packet/message to transfer
	• Local Area Network (LAN) - a group of connected devices
	• Ethernet cables - used to connect devices and send data over
	• Media Access Control (MAC) Address - unique serial assigned to each device
	• MAC addresses are used to ensure the right machine receives its message
	• Data sent over a network has the MAC address in the "header" of the message
	• Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CMSA)
	• Bandwidth - the rate that data can be sent
	• Exponential Backoff - the amount of time a device will wait after a network collision before retrying its send
	• Switch - used to separate and link machines across a network
	• Keeps a list of all devices MAC addresses to send to only the correct machine/network
	• Routers send data between and across networks
	• Hop count - the amount of hops (steps) a message takes across a network
	• Packets - large messages are broken up into smaller packets to be sent
	• Every device on a network has its own individual IP address

What is Programming?
Introduction to Computer Programming | What is it? Programming Language Types
	• Computers need instructions given to them to do things
	• These instructions are called "programs" and are written by "programmers"
	• There are programs to manage computer hardware - these are system programs
	• Other programs provide user functionality - such as music or video player, word, excel or notepad programs
	• Computers only understand binary language - 0 & 1
	• Binary uses electrical signals to communicate - 0 there is no current or communication, 1 there is a current and communication
	• Machine Level Language is called a low level language - written in Binary
	• Very hard to write machine level language
	• Assembly Level language is a low level language
	• It was created to help write code easier - written using numbers or symbols
	• Assembly language used an "Assembler" to translate into Binary
	• High level languages were created to make coding easier and closer to human language
	• Compilation and Interpretation are used to translate high level languages into computer binary language
	• Low level languages allow programmers to directly access the computer memory and work with data
	• High level languages cannot directly access the computer memory and work with data
	• There are Middle level languages can access the memory and data directly with all the features of High level languages
	• High Level Languages - Python, Java
	• Middle Level Languages - C, C++
	• Machine Language is the fastest, then Assembly then High Level Languages
	• Compilation uses a compiler to convert a program written in high level language and translate it into machine language
	• Interpretation uses an interpreter to read each line of a program, translate and then execute that line
	• Compilation compiles and translates a whole program in one go and runs the whole program
	• Interpretation interprets and runs each line one at a time of a program
	• Complied languages include C & C++
	• Interpreted languages include Python
 
What is Cloud Computing?

	• A third party (AWS, Azure) take over and look after a companies data and computer processing over the internet
	• Cloud is a utility that can be used for scalable, managed infrastructure
	• You will only pay for what you use from a cloud provider
	• It can grow and shrink as demands rise or fall
	• Cloud providers supply servers, storage and networking that customers do not need to manage
	• Compliance and regulations are followed to protect data
	• There are different levels of resource management cloud providers offer - 
		○ Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service) - high level of customer management
		○ PaaS (Platform as a Service) - mid level of customer management
		○ SaaS (Software as a Service) - very low level of customer management
 
What is DevOps?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZ2xmsSDdo
	• DevOps is the development, testing, release and maintenance of applications
	• Development teams will develop the application
	• Operations teams will take over and support the application once it is released into Production
	• DevOps aims to bridge the gap between Dev and Ops teams
	• There are lots of tools used to be able to continuously develop, test, package and push to Prod
	• Using DevOps tools and processes this aims to be automated so it can be done continuously
	• This is done by creating a CI/CD Pipeline - Continuous Integration (dev, test & packaging) and continuous deployment (pushing to Production)
 
What is a Cloud Engineer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i1WMGxyt4Q
	• A cloud engineer will build, monitor, administrate and architect cloud solutions and infrastructure
	• You may cover all of these areas or specialize in one - can be company dependent
	• Aim to learn one cloud provider really well - skills are transferable between them
	• Phoenix Project & DevOps handbook - book resources
	• Automated testing & CI/CD, monitoring and Infrastructure as Code are key skills
	• Understanding DevOps, programming and Cloud concepts are extremely important
	• Automation of tasks is a key skill for a Cloud engineer
	• Understanding why and when to use or do something is important for a cloud engineer
