 - DevOps is the development, testing, release and maintenance of applications
 - Development teams will develop the application
 - Operations teams will take over and support the application once it is released into Production
 - DevOps aims to bridge the gap between Dev and Ops teams
 - There are lots of tools used to be able to continuously develop, test, package and push to Prod
 - Using DevOps tools and processes this aims to be automated so it can be done continuously
 - This is done by creating a CI/CD Pipeline - Continuous Integration (dev, test & packaging) and continuous deployment (pushing to Production)
