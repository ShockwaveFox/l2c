#### What is Observability
- Observability is being able to see and know the health of an app from feedback such as logs and metrics
- It is key in ensuring an app stays available and functioning
- There are 3 main pillars -
    - logs - time stamped, granular events that can be used for trouble shooting and debugging
    - Traces - track the full end-to-end journey of user requests
    - Metrics - measures application and system health over a time period such as memory and CPU usage
- Observability tools collect and aggregate data for tracking health
- Dashboards can be set up to monitor and visualise all the tracked data easily
- The tools can help find unknown issues that can then be addressed
