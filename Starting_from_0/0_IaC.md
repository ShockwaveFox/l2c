#### Infrastructure as Code

- Infrstructure as Code is a way of managing infrastructure using configuration files
- These files can be consistently and repeatadly used and shared
- The files can be added to version control to track the history and changes made
- Terraform is the most common engine for IaC
- IaC scripts allow thousands of machines to be created or destroyed quickly through a script
- The scripts can be automated - E.G. build the machines in the morning, destroy at end of day
