#### What are Containers
- A container is way of packaging an application up with everything it needs to run into one unit
- This unit can then be moved between systems and environments and still work as expected
- Docker containers and Docker engine are the most widely and commonly used container software
- One OS can run multiple containers that run as isolated processes
- Containers are smaller and more lightweight than virtual machines
