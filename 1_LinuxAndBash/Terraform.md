#### What is Terraform
- Terraform is a tool that allows infrastructure to be defined as code
- It uses config files that are human readable and can be reused, shared and added to version control
- It manages hardware - vms, databases, networking - and other things like DNS entries
 - Terraform uses application programming interfaces (APIs) to work with services like cloud providers
 - A workflow for Terraform has 3 stages -
    - Write - resources are defined in the configuration file
    - Plan - Terraform creates a plan for what it is going to build or destroy for approval before starting
    - Apply - Terraform will execute the approved plan
- There is a Terraform registry which trcks all providers that use Terraform
- It tracks all current and existing infrastructure in a state file 
- It uses this file to check what will be change in the plan
- Config files are declarative - they are written to say how the infrastructure should look in its end, deployed state
- It is not needed to write step by step instructions because of this
- Modules can be written which are collections of regularly used infrastructure to save time
- These modules can be modified
- Config files and modules can be added to version control for tracking and sharing
