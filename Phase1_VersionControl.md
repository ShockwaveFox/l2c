- Git is a version control system
- A version control system tracks all changes made to a project over time in a repository
- It allows viewing a projects history to see who made what changes and when they were made
- You can easily revert back to an earlier version of the project
- Git is a distributed system - everyone can download a copy of the project to work on meaning there is no single point of failure
- This allows Multiple people can work on the same project at the same time using Git
- Git can be used through the command line, a GUI tool or in text editors
- A git commit is like taking a snapshot of the current project and adding it to the repo
- Modified files are added to the staging area for review before being committed / creating a snapshot
- Each commit should have a message explaining what was changed so it is easy to see the project state and history
- Every commit has a unique ID identifier
- Branches can be created separately from the main development project for fixes to be worked on independently and then added / merged back into the main project
- Common git phrases -
	- Working tree/main - all the main files for the project - where you make changes
	- Staging area - waiting area for changes before they are committed
	- Repository/repo - database that holds the permanent records of a projects history
	- Hash - unique identifier number for a version of a file - if the file contents are changed the hash changes
	- Four types of Object - 
		- Blob - a normal file
		- Tree - a directory 
		- Commit - a specific working tree version
		- Tag - the name given to a commit
	- Branch - separate from the main working tree - used to work independently on fixes before merging back into the main
	- Remote - a reference to a different git directory
	- Commands - used to perform operations in the terminal
		- Git push
		- Git pull
- GitHub - a cloud platform that integrates with Git to store and hold files and repos

- Git restore --staged - moves files out of the staged area back into the working directory

	- Will only remove tracked files
- Git clean - removes all untracked files
- git diff - see changes made that are not in the staged area
- git diff --staged - shows the changes made to files in the staging area before committing them
	- diff --git a/file1.js b/file1.js - **compares the copy of "a/file1" to the copy of "b/file1"**
